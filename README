This is a basic Rails app that is being built as a class project in the spring of 2011.  This is version 1 with another version planned to extend the site functionality and help students become more familiar with the Rails 3 framework.

The class is Application Design & Development and is for Information Systems students at Carnegie Mellon University (campuses both in Pittsburgh and Doha).  We have posted this application on heroku.com (phase2-67272) so students get some idea of what is expected.

This project does require the use of several gems to work properly.  Check the Gemfile to see which gems are used.  Also, unit testing requires the gems factory_girl, shoulda be installed before running tests.  For cucumber tests, students should use the following versions:

	cucumber-rails (0.4.0)
	capybara (0.4.1.2)
	json (1.5.1)
	gherkin (2.3.5)
