Instructions for the grader:

1. rake db:migrate

This migrates the database and creates the default user:

username: MrsH
password: alex&mark

You can make parties and guests and invitations.

2. rake test:prepare

3. rake test:units

4. rake db:populate

I wrote the populating script myself. It created 5 parties and guests and invites them.
